# GraPen

> This web service approximates curves drawn with a pen and displays them in mathematical formulas. It is useful for math graph art in conjunction with Desmos.

## Features

- **Curve Approximation**  
  Drawn curves are approximated using:
  - Piecewise linear functions
  - Linear functions
  - Quadratic functions  
  (Future updates will support arcs, Bézier curves, etc.)

- **Editing & Optimization**
  - Move and optimize curves
  - Import/export curves as JSON
  - Save images of your graphs

- **Usability**
  - Intuitive pen drawing interface
  - Multiple curve management

## Usage

1. Draw a curve freely with your mouse or touch device.
2. The system automatically detects the curve type and converts/displays it as an optimal approximation.
3. You can edit, move, or optimize the curve as needed.
4. Save your work as an image or JSON file.
5. (Planned) Export to Desmos for further editing.
